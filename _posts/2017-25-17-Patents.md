<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> completed my Btech and Mtech (dual degree course) in microelectronics from IIT Bombay, department of electrical engineering, earning the degrees in 2007. Straight out of college I started my career with IBM Microelectronics, as a semiconductor device modeling engineer. Over the span of 7 years, my work with IBM involved

* Statical methods for selection of the "Golden Die" out of wafer batches and lots. 
* Compact modeling of passive semiconductor devices
* Modeling of on-chip Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection devices.
* 6T SRAM design with 14nm SOI technology

I joined Cadence design systems as a senior product engineer in 2014. Subsequently I managed a team of engineers working in the field of Signal Integrity (SI/PI) and IP modeling. My work at Cadence involved modeling of high speed serial links (USB, HDMI, SATA etc) and parallel dual data read interfaces (DDR, LPDDR etc). I designed and executed several automation projects using python and ruby, aiming to improve teams efficiency and cut down project turnaround time. 

Many of my ideas have resulted in patent applications. I have 5 patent applications filed in US PTO, three as the primary author. 

[Boost control to improve SRAM write operation](https://patents.justia.com/patent/9548104) <br />
[Gate strain induced work function engineering](https://patents.justia.com/patent/9105498) <br />
[Component behavior modeling using separate behavior model](https://patents.justia.com/patent/8954306) <br />
[Silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) clamp including metal insulator transition (MIT) resistor ](https://patents.justia.com/patent/8929039) <br />
[Silicon controlled rectifier modeling](https://patents.justia.com/patent/8489378) <br />

I am a self taught Ruby on Rails developer with working knowledge of full stack development. Here is a list of projects I am involved with
* [Wishweb](https://www.worldwishweb.com/): I designed the architecture and coded the wishweb right from the idea to api. At the back end, wishweb works on Ruby on Rails with Postgres database. The wishweb Android app acts as the front end that talks to the api. 
* [Fabbon](http://fabbon.com/): I act as a technology advisor to Fabbon; a beauty centric social media and content marketing platform. 

Currently I am involved with a new pursuit in an exciting field of work. Though, its probably too early to talk about it :)   

Please feel free to contact me if I can be of any help.
