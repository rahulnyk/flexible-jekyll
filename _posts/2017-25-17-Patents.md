<span class="firstcharacter">A</span>s a semiconductor engineer, over the course of my professional career I have worked in the following fields arranged chronologically. 
* Compact modeling of passive semiconductor devices
* Modeling of onchip Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection devices.
* 6T SRAM design with 14nm SOI technology
* Signal integrity IP modeling of DDR and serial links. 

I have filed five patent applications in these fields, three as primary author. Here is a list of my patents.
