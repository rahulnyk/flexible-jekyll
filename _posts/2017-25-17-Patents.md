So, as I mentioned, I am a semiconductor engineer by profession. I have filed a five patent applications till now, 3 of them as primary author. Here is a list of my patents.

	## <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/9548104">Boost control to improve SRAM write operation </a> 
	Approaches for providing write-assist boost for a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) array are provided. A circuit includes a write driver of a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) array. The circuit also includes a boost circuit that dynamically varies a write-assist boost voltage based on a stability assist setting applied to a wordline of the array. <br />

## <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/9105498">Gate strain induced work function engineering</a>
A stack of a gate dielectric layer and a workfunction material layer are deposited over a plurality of semiconductor material portions, which can be a plurality of semiconductor fins or a plurality of active regions in a semiconductor substrate. A first gate conductor material applying a first stress is formed on a first portion of the workfunction material layer located on a first semiconductor material portion, and a second gate conductor material applying a second stress is formed on a second portion of the workfunction material layer located on a second semiconductor material portion. The first and second stresses are different in at least one of polarity and magnitude, thereby inducing different strains in the first and second portions of the workfunction material layer. The different strains cause the workfunction shift differently in the first and second portions of the workfunction material layer, thereby providing devices having multiple different workfunctions. <br />
