If cameras could appreciate beauty as well as the human eye, the art of photography would be lost. Thankfully that is not the case. I am a hobbiest photographer who is inching towards offbeat experimental professional photography. My work includes mostly portraits and landscapes.

# Portraits
Portraits is what I love to click the most. It is one of the most interesting classes of photography. Portraits are photographs which speaks more than thousand words. They narrate stories, capture memories and describe personalities. Portraits is also probably one of the toughest class of photography. A great number of skills involved in photography are put to test when creating portraits. <br />

I love to edit my portraits with surrealistic effects. With every click I have been increasingly experimental. I have experimented with indoor studio as well as outdoor settings. Most of the time I love to play with lights creating dramatic and surrealistic effects. My speciality is to click directly against the sun. Over the past few years, I have developed my own image editing methods and recipes. Lately I have also started taking image editing assignments with photograph shot by someone else. 

I hope find my niche and create a big portfolio in offbeat experimental portraits. If you think you have patience to be in front of my camera and be a part of my experiments, please feel free to contact me. I can promise pleasing results :)
