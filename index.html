    <span class="firstcharacter">H</span>i There, this is Rahul. 
    Welcome to my personal portfolio <br /><br />

    I am an engineer by profession and I am quite passionate about technology. Apart from skills in Semiconductor engineering, I am proficient in Ruby on Rails with a good knowledge of full stack development. I also enjoy occasional data analysis and visualization gigs using R and Python. I have 5 technology patent applications in my name, three of which are now granted. <br />

    I Have been working with a few startups, as a technology and strategy adviser. I enjoy working with new ideas from concept to product. <br /> 

    I have a keen interest in Photography including the art, the science and the history behind it. Most of my work includes surrealistic portraits with dramatic lights, Landscapes and Time-lapse Videos.  I spend a good amount of effort processing my photographs and I like to be increasingly experimental with every project I do. Over the years I have invented several photo and time-lapse editing techniques in order to keep improving my work. Occasionally I write about these techniques as well.  <br />

    I am always up for long road trips. I very much feel at home on the highways. I am a foodie and will never hesitate to travel any distance even if just for food :) <br /> 
    Please feel free to contact me using any of the icons below, I would be much obliged to hear from you. <br /> <br />
