    <h1>Hi There, this is Rahul</h1>
    <p >
      <span class="firstcharacter">W</span>elcome to my website. <br />
      Being an engineer, or in spite of it, I am passionate about science and technology. Professionally I have worked in the field of microelectronics for more than 11 years now. I have 5 patent applications in the fields of Semiconductor modeling, semiconductor devices and SRAM design. three of them are now granted. 
      <br />
      I have mentored few of my junior coleagues helping them understand their career dillemas and life goals. <br />
      <i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> Please visit my linkedin profile for more information about my proessional journey. 
      <br />
      I am a profecient Ruby on Rails developer with a good knowledge of full stack development. Occasionally I use a little bit of data science with R on the side for some intellectual stimulation. <br />
      I have been associated with a few early stage startups, as a technology consultant. I help them design their technology platform from architecture to coding. 
      Please feel free to contact me if I can help you or be associated with your ideas. 
      
      <br />
      I have a strong artistic alter ego. I am keenly interest in graphic design, Photography and Videography. 

      I have developed some skills in #Photography, photo editing and videography. I like to click and develop my photograhs with surrealistic effects. Portraits are my favorite, though landscapes comes a close second. Please bless me with a visit to my <a href="https://500px.com/rahulnayak" style="text-decoration: none;">photoblog <i class="fa fa-500px" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br />
      As an extention to my love for camera, I also love to make #Timelapses. I updaate these clips on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/aihikii" style="text-decoration: none">youtube <i class="fa fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> as often as I make them. <br />
