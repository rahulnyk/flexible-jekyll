    <h1>Hi There, this is Rahul</h1>
    <p >
      <span class="firstcharacter">W</span>elcome to my website. <br />
      This site is the summary of my work. Being an engineer (or in spite of it) I am passionate about science and technology. Professionally I have worked as a semiconductor engineer for more than 11 years now. I have 5 patent applications in my name, three of them are now granted. <br /><br />
      I also pursue web development (Ruby on Rails) with good knowledge of full stack development as a hobby in order develop my own little ideas and help friends develop theirs. Occasionally I use a little bit of data science with R on the side for some intellectual stimulation. <br /><br />
      I have an artistic alter ego. I have developed some skills in #Photography, photo editing and videography. I like to click and develop my photograhs with surrealistic effects. Portraits are my favorite, though landscapes comes a close second. Please bless me with a visit to my <a href="https://500px.com/rahulnayak">photoblog <i class="fa fa-500px" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br />
      As an extention to my love for camera, I also love to make #Timelapses. I updaate these clips on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/aihikii">youtube <i class="fa fa-youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> as often as I make them. <br /> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a list of things I do <br />
