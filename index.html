      I am a profecient Ruby on Rails developer with a good knowledge of full stack development. Occasionally I use a little bit of data science with R on the side for some intellectual stimulation. <br />
      I have been associated with a few early stage startups, as a technology consultant. I help them design their technology platform from architecture to coding.

      I have a strong artistic alter ego. I am keenly interest in graphic design, Photography and Videography. <br />

      I have the greatest love for #Photography. I like to click and develop my photograhs with surrealistic effects. Portraits are my favorite, though landscapes comes a close second. Occasionally I also write short tutorials on photography and photo editing. <br />
